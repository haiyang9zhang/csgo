    """
    Enumeration type for the single target track state. Newly created tracks are
    classified as `tentative` until enough evidence has been collected. Then,

class Track:
    """
    A single target track with state space `(x, y, a, h)` and associated
    velocities, where `(x, y)` is the center of the bounding box, `a` is the
    aspect ratio and `h` is the height.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mean : ndarray
        Mean vector of the initial state distribution.
    covariance : ndarray
        Covariance matrix of the initial state distribution.
    track_id : int
        A unique track identifier.
    n_init : int                                                   # 跟踪被确认前连续检测的次数（状态标识阈值）
        Number of consecutive detections before the track is confirmed. The
        track state is set to `Deleted` if a miss occurs within the first
        `n_init` frames.
    max_age : int
        The maximum number of consecutive misses before the track state is
        set to `Deleted`.
    feature : Optional[ndarray]
        Feature vector of the detection this track originates from. If not None,
        this feature is added to the `features` cache.

    Attributes
    ----------
    mean : ndarray
        Mean vector of the initial state distribution.
    covariance : ndarray
        Covariance matrix of the initial state distribution.
    track_id : int
        A unique track identifier.       # 唯一的跟踪标识符
    hits : int
        Total number of measurement updates.    # 追踪帧数
    age : int
        Total number of frames since first occurance.  # 自第一次出现以来的总帧数。
    time_since_update : int
        Total number of frames since last measurement update.  # 丢失的帧总数。
    state : TrackState
        The current track state.                   # 当前跟踪状态
    features : List[ndarray]
        A cache of features. On each measurement update, the associated feature
        vector is added to this list.           # 特征的缓存。在每次度量更新中，关联的特征向量被添加到这个列表中。
